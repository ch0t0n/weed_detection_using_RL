Notebook to run: multi_agent_aug20.ipynb

IMPORTANT: Restart the kernal each time before running any of the set of instructions 1,2,3 or 4.
NEVER press the cross button in pygame window, restart the kernal instead.

1. Instructions for random play using pygame:
First run cell 1,2,3,4, then cell 5 for random play

2. Instructions for playing with trained network using pygame:
first run cell 1,2,3,4, then cell 9 for loading the trained network, and cell 10 for playing

3. Instructions for random play with simulations:
IMPORTANT: Close any previously opened scene file. Never save the scene file while closing.
First open the scene file "drone_test_scene_aug14.ttt" using CoppeliaSim robot simulator.
Run cell 1,2,3,4 for initialization. Run cell 12 for initializing the simulator and cell 13 for playing.
Use cell 15 to stop once finished.
