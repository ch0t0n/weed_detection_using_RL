# Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning For Herbicide Spraying Using Reinforcement Learning

**Notebook to run:** `multi_agent_aug20.ipynb`

**IMPORTANT:** Restart the kernel each time before running any of the below set of instructions

**NEVER** press the "X" button in the PyGame window, restart the kernel instead.

## Instructions for random actions using PyGame

1. Run cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 for environment setup
2. Run cell 5 for random actions

## Instructions for acting with trained network using PyGame

1. Run cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 for environment setup
2. Run cell 9 to load the trained network
3. Run cell 10 for acting with the trained network

## Instructions for random actions using CoppeliaSim

**IMPORTANT:** Close any previously opened scene file. Never save the scene file while closing.

1. Open the scene file `simulation_env/drone_test_scene_aug14.ttt` using CoppeliaSim robot simulator
2. Run cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 for environment setup
3. Run cell 12 to initialize the simulator
4. Run cell 13 for random actions
5. Run cell 15 to stop the simulator once finished
